<a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> pointed out these gems:

<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf">Scala Reference 6.12.3</a>

<strong>Precedence</strong>:
"The precedence of an inﬁx operator is determined by the operator’s ﬁrst character."

<strong>Associativity</strong>
"The associativity of an operator is determined by the operator’s last character"

This actually made me cry.
