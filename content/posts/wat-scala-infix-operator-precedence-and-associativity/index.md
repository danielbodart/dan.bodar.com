[Nat Pryce](http://www.natpryce.com/) pointed out these gems:

[Scala Reference 6.12.3](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf)

**Precedence**:  
"The precedence of an inﬁx operator is determined by the operator’s ﬁrst character."

**Associativity**  
"The associativity of an operator is determined by the operator’s last character"

This actually made me cry.
