Related to my [QCon talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Crazy-Fast-Build-Times-or-When-10-Seconds-Starts-to-Make-You-Nervous) and original [blog post](http://dan.bodar.com/2012/02/28/crazy-fast-build-times-or-when-10-seconds-starts-to-make-you-nervous/), I'm soft launching my [10second.build](https://10second.build/) project.
