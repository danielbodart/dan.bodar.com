**Decoupling Resource selection from Representation selection in our Urls**

This will allow resources (domain objects/documents) to be selected (think SQL WHERE clauses) and presenters re-used by the client editors without specific coding by developers. So a url like "/video/skins/latest" could return all videos tagged with skins or possibly any resource tagged with video and skins. What we are aiming for is totally dynamic / fluid urls with uses we never imagined.

**Mashups**

Editors will be able to mashup YouTube videos, Facebook items, MySpace pages, Flickr images etc. into pretty much any where on the site. Users will be able to mashup client content / videos onto any other site.

**Social Networking**

Allowing users to rate each others content, interact with client content / users and other social networking sites and generally use the site in new and interesting ways

**Caching**

We will be totally embracing web caching so that all non current user specific content will be cache able. User specific content will be included client side (in an accessible way) so containing pages do not need to be made non cache able.
