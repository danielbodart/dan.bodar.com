So many moons ago I was reading about a fullscreen editor for Mac called WriteRoom. The basic premise is that it is a very limited editor that actively aims to block out all distractions from writing. It achieves this by:

- Running fullscreen (so no desktop distractions)
- Supporting plain text only (so no styling distractions)
- No toolbar
- No menubar
- No statusbar
- A few simple shortcuts to do what you need

Anyway I have been running Ubuntu for a number of years, and had often ran Nano fullscreen in a Gnome Terminal but was curious what might now be available. So a few moments googling and this was the list:

- [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) for Mac
- [DarkRoom](http://they.misled.us/dark-room) for Windows
- [q10](http://www.baara.com/q10/) for Windows
- [PyRoom](http://pyroom.org/) for Linux
- [Focussed](http://spreadingfunkyness.com/focused/) for Adobe Air

After trying each one, I decided that I actually really liked the q10 version and even though it runs perfectly on Linux via Wine, it just takes way to long to startup (2-3 seconds). Mean while the PyRoom version starts in less than 200ms, so after upgrading to 0.41 I was able to get PyRoom looking very similar to q10 with the following settings:

- Green screen theme
- 95% height
- 62% width
- Padding 5
- No border
- Autosave
- BitStream Vera Sans font

The only thing I am missing is it remembering what file I was last editing, maybe it's time I brushed up my Python skills.
