Now for some web specific whys/values I do the in-memory acceptance testing...

<ul>
	<li>Semantic Html is my golden hammer</li>
	<li>Progressive enhancement is my swiss army knife</li>
	<li>I love JavaScript but try to never write any but if i must I make sure it's generic. I try very hard to make sure no else writes any either and if they do I just refactor it till it deletes itself.</li>
	<li>I love AHAH and barely tolerate AJAX / JSON</li>
	<li>REST is my natural state not something I read about</li>
</ul>


All of these forces / values / beliefs drive me to solve the problem of web testing in a very different approach from most people. It is about an alternative holistic approach to web architecture, testing and productivity. 

So now I have expressed some of the forces / the whys, I will try cover the hows and whats.
