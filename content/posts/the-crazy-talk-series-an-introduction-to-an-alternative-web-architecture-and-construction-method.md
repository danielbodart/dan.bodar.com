<p>If you have met me or worked with me in the last 15 years or so, you will know that I am pretty mad about the web as a platform, HTTP as a protocol and HTML as a state engine. Add to this the last 6 years or so practising agile techniques while building highly scalable websites and you tend to find that I have fairly unusual views in the field about how to build and architect web applications.</p>
<p>A lot of people say to me, <q>Dan, you must write about X as the industry seems to be doing Y</q> and while I find it very easy to talk in a face-to-face conversation or even a mailing list, writing an article or post has always been a challenge due to the one way nature of the conversation. Anyway after some gentle nudging by <a href="http://sarahtaraporewalla.com/">Sarah Taraporewalla</a>, <a href="http://christianralph.blogspot.com/">Christian Blunden</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> I have decided to jump in head first and try and create a series of articles that will hopefully open a few peoples eye's to some alternatives.</p>
<p>So enough with the why and onto the what I'm planning to cover in the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caching on the wire not in the app</li>
<li>Addressable components</li>
<li>Personalisation, cachability and composition</li>
<li>Moving state off the web server</li>
<li>Web server decoupling, in-memory testing and lightning fast builds</li>
<li>Some alternative libraries</li>
<li>Common HTTP patterns</li>
</ul>
