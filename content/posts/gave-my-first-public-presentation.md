Well <a href="http://blog.bellubbi.com/">Kiran</a> and I both gave our first public presentations at the <a href="http://overtheair.org/">OverTheAir</a> mobile conference at the Imperial College.

Kiran talked about Agile & Mobile development and I talked about <a href="http://pe.bodar.com/">Progressive Enhancement</a>
