<p><strong>Just because something is compelling doesn't mean it's right</strong><br>i.e. transitive dependencies or the easiest location to add feature X in your codebase</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Plugins are a sign of bad composeability or lack of craftsmanship or both</strong><br>i.e Ridiculous NPM modules that plugin your test tool into your transpiler into your bundler into your web server or equally insane Spring plugins. Maybe look at the unix way...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Libraries are overused and under understood</strong><br>i.e most day to day problems are easier to solve from first principles than deciphering the README of some library. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tools that haven't had any updates in ages aren't dead, but just finished.</strong><br>i.e "ls" or "cat" or "less", knowing when to stop adding features is actually the hard part</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Simple isn't something you start a project with and reminisce about, it's where you are trying to get to</strong><br>Red/Green/Refactor is wrong, it's like trying to write a test afterwards, most of the time it's too late. It should be spike, revert, spike, revert, refactor, refactor, refactor,1 line code change, done - but it's not as catchy!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To go really really fast you need to consciously go really really slow </strong><br>Conscious and deliberate decision making about roles and responsibility in your shared mental model will always trump how fast you can hack something into the codebase</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It's not about top down or bottom up, it's about known to unknown</strong><br>It doesn't matter where you start as long as you start from some where you recognise, don't start in the middle of the f**ing ocean and wonder why you got lost</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>When it's hard to change something, that's the codebase trying to talk to you, so put the pneumatic hammer away and listen. </strong><br>Once you have heard enough, you will know exactly what to do (well until it starts talking to you again)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Data structures aren't the reserve of the CS geek, the right one will literally embody the answer to your problem</strong><br>Lists and maps will get the job done but you could do it with 80% less code and 80% faster, plus you can write clean code unlike most CS geeks...</p>

<p><strong>Being a 10x developer isn't about being 10x better or faster, it's about doing 10x less...</strong><br>...of the wrong things or going the wrong way at a million miles an hour. (And maybe asking 10x more questions)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally the most important question you can ever ask is: <strong>How would we do this without computers?</strong></p>
