I found the bit where you criticise the red-green-refactor dogma really interesting. It seems like you're saying two things:\r\n- 'spike' should be added as a step in the cycle.\r\n- It's not a cycle. It's more like a graph, or playbook, through which a few different paths could be taken.\r\n\r\nAny plans on adding to the course?","parent":0}

I think to actually make it enjoyable to watch I need to do multi camera angles and do screen capture at the same time. \r\n\r\nWere there any particular subjects you were interested in?","parent":0}

It might be difficult to find bite-sized examples though. \r\n\r\nThe points about attitude and approach are the most interesting to me, e.g \"To go really really fast you need to consciously go really really slow\".\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that there are few role models in software for this kind of thing - perhaps because it's an activity that's difficult to observe. I find myself looking elsewhere for inspiration. I have been watching Adam Ondra's (world-famous climber) 'Road to Tokyo' youtube series recently. He'll often spend an hour analysing and mentally rehearsing a boulder problem before he even gets on the wall.","parent":0}

So I've been working on a little side project for the last couple of weeks to try and create a video based training school to allow myself to scale and maybe not have to repeat myself as much when ever I join a new client.

So I decided to take my post on the [Uncommon Sense](http://dan.bodar.com/2019/02/09/uncommon-sense/) and turn that into a [mini course](https://software-mastery.teachable.com/p/uncommon-sense/) to try things out.

This was in some ways just an excuse to learn about DSLR filming (read buy some toys), non-linear editing, colour grading etc. Now it's not perfect (the audio isn't great as my shotgun mic wasn't working) but it feels good enough to share.

Let me know what you think or what else you might like to see.

- Panasonic G80

- Capture: MediaExpress (MJPEG)
