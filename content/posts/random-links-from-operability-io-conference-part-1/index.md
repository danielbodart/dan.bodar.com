These are my random links from the excellent 2 day conference [Operability.IO](http://operability.io/). These are all links mentioned in different talks.

[Worse is Better](https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html)  
Much to the shock of my collages I had not read about this before. Now I have!

[OSV](http://osv.io/) / [Capstan](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/capstan)  
I've been using [hyper.sh](https://hyper.sh/) which is very similar except it uses Docker images inside the hypervisor. OSV looks very interesting especially the REST API for [inspecting a running image](http://osv.io/api/swagger-ui/dist/index.html).

[MirageOS](https://mirage.io/)  
This is a unikernel for compiling OCaml to Xen hypervisor

[Google Borg Paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43438.pdf)  
Interesting paper but I'm not working in this space so hard to appreciate all the details.

[Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods](http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/)  
Lots of great bits of advice. Question: When would knowing the 50th percentile ever be valuable?

[Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity](http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/distributed/CG%20final.pdf)

[Engineering for the Long Game - Astrid Atkinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0jGmgIrf_M)

[Antifragile - Things That Gain From Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)
