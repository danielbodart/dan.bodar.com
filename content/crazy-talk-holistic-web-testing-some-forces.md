So given the above, the forces I am trying to balance are

<ul> 
	<li>Make it easy for people to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing.</li>
	<li>Make it valuable (Finds more bugs than false alarms)</li>
	<li>Make it resilient (Allows me to refactor like the true crazy person I am)</li>
	<li>Make it fast (Magnify it's value rather deminishing it)</li>
	<li>Make it good enough (Give me enough confidence to do more crazy stuff but don't become dogmatic)</li>
	<li>Allow people to do what they are good at</li>
</ul>

Next I'll talk about how the default setup I use to do, in-memory, out of container testing.
