<p>So many moons ago I was reading about a fullscreen editor for Mac called WriteRoom. The basic premise is that it is a very limited editor that actively aims to block out all distractions from writing. It achieves this by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Running fullscreen (so no desktop distractions)</li>
	<li>Supporting plain text only (so no styling distractions)</li>
	<li>No toolbar</li>
	<li>No menubar</li>
	<li>No statusbar</li>
	<li>A few simple shortcuts to do what you need</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway I have been running Ubuntu for a number of years, and had often ran Nano fullscreen in a Gnome Terminal but was curious what might now be available. So a few moments googling and this was the list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> for Mac</li>	
	<li><a href="http://they.misled.us/dark-room">DarkRoom</a> for Windows</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.baara.com/q10/">q10</a> for Windows</li>
	<li><a href="http://pyroom.org/">PyRoom</a> for Linux</li>
	<li><a href="http://spreadingfunkyness.com/focused/">Focussed</a> for Adobe Air</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying each one, I decided that I actually really liked the q10 version and even though it runs perfectly on Linux via Wine, it just takes way to long to startup (2-3 seconds). Mean while the PyRoom version starts in less than 200ms, so after upgrading to 0.41 I was able to get PyRoom looking very similar to q10 with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Green screen theme</li>
	<li>95% height</li>
	<li>62% width</li>
	<li>Padding 5</li>
	<li>No border</li>
	<li>Autosave</li>
	<li>BitStream Vera Sans font</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I am missing is it remembering what file I was last editing, maybe it's time I brushed up my Python skills.</p>
